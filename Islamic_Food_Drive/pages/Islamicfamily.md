**2\. Introduction to Islamic Family:**

* 2.1. Purpose, Mission, and Guiding Values:  
  Islamic Family operates with a clear and compelling purpose: to support the flourishing of the whole person within the community.1 This overarching aim is brought to life through a mission grounded in compassion, support, and advocacy.1 These principles are not merely aspirational; they are actively embodied in every facet of the organization's work, shaping its programs and interactions with the community it serves. The ethical framework of Islamic Family is further defined by three core values: inclusivity, compassion, and being community-led.  
  Inclusivity is a foundational tenet for Islamic Family, as evidenced by its declaration that its "doors are open to everyone," with a commitment to supporting individuals "of all backgrounds and beliefs". This welcoming stance ensures that the organization serves a diverse population without discrimination, fostering a sense of belonging for all who seek its assistance. Complementing inclusivity is the value of compassion, which dictates that Islamic Family leads with care, striving to ensure that everyone who reaches out feels "heard, valued, and understood". This emphasis on empathy and a supportive approach underpins all interactions and service delivery, creating a safe and nurturing environment for those in need. Finally, the organization is deeply committed to being community-led, a value that manifests in its practice of developing programs through direct conversations with the community, thereby ensuring that its initiatives directly address the needs that are voiced. This responsiveness and community-driven approach ensures that Islamic Family remains relevant and effective in meeting the evolving needs of Edmontonians. The seamless integration of purpose, mission, and values provides a robust ethical foundation upon which Islamic Family builds its impactful work. The purpose sets the ultimate goal, the mission outlines the methods for achieving it, and the values serve as the guiding principles that inform every action taken by the organization. This interconnectedness fosters a strong sense of integrity and a deep commitment to the Edmonton community.  
* 2.2. A Brief History of Establishment and Growth in Edmonton:  
  The story of Islamic Family in Edmonton began in 1986 with humble origins in the basement of a community member affectionately known as Uncle Jalal. This grassroots initiative marked the beginning of an enduring commitment to uplift the local community through culturally sensitive care. In 1992, the organization took a significant step forward by officially incorporating as IFSSA (Islamic Family & Social Services Association). As the need for its services grew, so did the organization's capacity. By the year 2000, the food bank operations had expanded to the point where a dedicated space was required, leading to the opening of the Tiny South Warehouse for food aid. This expansion demonstrated the increasing demand for essential resources within the community and IFSSA's proactive response.  
  The organization continued its trajectory of growth and service diversification, launching an outreach and counselling program in 2009\. This marked a significant step towards providing more holistic support to individuals and families facing various challenges. In 2010, recognizing the importance of investing in the younger generation, IFSSA initiated its youth program. The period between 2015 and 2016 saw the formal commencement of IFSSA's housing project, aimed at addressing the critical need for stable and affordable accommodation within the community. A pivotal year for the organization was 2016, during which it achieved the esteemed status of a refugee sponsorship agreement holder. This accreditation allowed IFSSA to play a more direct role in helping refugees find safety and build new lives in Edmonton. Also in 2016, IFSSA established a vital partnership with the Edmonton Food Bank, further strengthening its capacity to nurture the community by addressing food insecurity. In 2018, IFSSA expanded its reach to support marginalized populations through the launch of a prison programming initiative and the establishment of Global Stitches, a program designed to empower refugee women with sewing skills. Embracing the digital age, 2020 saw the launch of Transform, a project focused on leveraging technology to enhance community work and service delivery. A significant milestone in the organization's history was the official opening of The Hüb in 2022, providing a new and central space for its diverse activities and community engagement. Most recently, in 2024, the organization underwent a rebranding, adopting the name IslamicFamily, a change that reflects its evolving identity and broader scope of services. From its initial focus on alleviating hunger and poverty, Islamic Family has steadily evolved into a comprehensive social service provider, demonstrating remarkable growth, adaptability, and a consistent commitment to addressing the ever-changing needs of the Edmonton community.2 This historical progression from a small, grassroots effort to a multifaceted organization underscores a deep-rooted dedication and an impressive capacity to scale its positive impact over time. Each key milestone in its history highlights a proactive response to specific challenges faced by the community, solidifying its role as a vital support system in Edmonton.

**3\. Comprehensive Services and Programs:**

* 3.1. Essential Needs:  
  Islamic Family is dedicated to meeting the most fundamental requirements of individuals and families in urgent need by providing essential needs such as food, shelter, and basic necessities.1 A crucial aspect of this service is their collaboration with the Edmonton Food Bank, a partnership established in 2016 to enhance their collective ability to support the community.1 Through this collaboration and their own pantry services, Islamic Family distributes a significant number of food hampers monthly, ensuring that vulnerable individuals and families have access to essential nutrition.1 In 2024 alone, they distributed 8,500 food hampers, demonstrating the scale of their efforts to combat food insecurity in Edmonton.7 This focus on addressing basic needs forms a critical foundation of Islamic Family's community support, as it directly alleviates immediate hardship and provides a stable platform for individuals and families to address other challenges they may be facing. The partnership with the Edmonton Food Bank significantly amplifies their reach and operational efficiency, allowing them to serve a larger segment of the population in need.

To ensure accessibility for a diverse community, their team of counsellors speaks ten different languages.1 The significant need for these services is evident in the 1000 counselling sessions provided in 2024 alone.3 Addressing mental health with such cultural and religious sensitivity highlights Islamic Family's deep understanding of the unique needs within the community. Offering services in multiple languages effectively breaks down barriers to access, ensuring that more individuals can receive the support they need in a comfortable and understanding environment. The integration of Islamic principles into the counselling approach further enhances its relevance and comfort for many within the community, fostering trust and encouraging individuals to seek help when needed.

  A significant aspect of Islamic Family's work involves providing comprehensive support to immigrants and refugees, helping them to successfully integrate and thrive in their new communities in Edmonton.1 This support encompasses various forms of assistance, including facilitating refugee sponsorship and providing aid to evacuees.1 As a federally-approved Sponsorship Agreement Holder (SAH), Islamic Family plays a crucial role in helping families with connections to Edmonton privately sponsor refugees.1 In 2024, they processed over 150 refugee sponsorship applications and successfully accepted more than 20, assisting families from Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen in establishing new lives in Canada.1 Beyond sponsorship, they also offer practical support to newcomers, such as guidance in navigating public services and understanding their rights.10 This multifaceted approach to newcomer support underscores Islamic Family's commitment to fostering a vibrant and inclusive Edmonton by facilitating the successful integration of individuals and families from diverse backgrounds. Their recognized status as an SAH highlights their expertise and credibility in the complex refugee sponsorship process, enabling them to effectively support both the refugees seeking a new home and the community members eager to help them.

The inclusion of a mentorship program provides invaluable support and guidance from experienced professionals, helping youth to build confidence, set meaningful goals, and navigate the various challenges of adolescence and young adulthood.  
* 3.6. Support Groups:  
  Islamic Family recognizes the power of peer connections and provides support groups that serve as safe spaces for individuals to connect with others who may share similar experiences and challenges.1 These groups offer a sense of community and understanding, allowing participants to share their stories, learn from one another, and build supportive networks.

By connecting youth with mentors who have a wealth of experience, Islamic Family aims to provide positive role models and foster the development of future leaders within the community. Mentorship programs like this can have a profound impact on a young person's life, offering personalized support and encouragement that can significantly contribute to their personal and professional growth.

By providing access to opportunities for skill enhancement and educational advancement, Islamic Family empowers individuals to improve their livelihoods, pursue their personal goals, and become more active and engaged members of the Edmonton community.  
* 3.9. Prison Programming & Re-Entry:  
  Islamic Family extends its support to a particularly vulnerable population through its dedicated Prison Programming & Re-Entry initiative.1 This program focuses on fostering community connections, providing advocacy and essential resources, and supporting the personal growth of individuals within the carceral system. A notable achievement within this program is the successful advocacy for the provision of meals that cater to Islamic dietary needs within prisons.4 This significant change, approved by the government, ensures that incarcerated Muslims have access to faith-appropriate diets, upholding their religious rights and dignity. The program also involves regular prison visits by a dedicated and trained team member to correctional institutions in Edmonton and surrounding areas, offering support to individuals regardless of their religious background.13 Faith-specific services, such as Friday prayers, are also offered. Additionally, regular programming like tapestry making at the Edmonton Institution for Women and a bi-weekly Muslim men's group at Grierson Institution are provided.13 Support extends beyond incarceration through regular dinners held at Edmonton-area halfway houses, offering those transitioning out of the prison system a sense of community, solace, and support as they begin new lives.13 The team also actively advocates for the rights of individuals in prisons and on parole, including their religious rights, and provides crucial support by writing letters and attending parole hearings.13 Furthermore, Islamic Family works to deliver handmade tasbihs (prayer beads) and prayer rugs to Muslims in correctional facilities.13 By providing comprehensive support to incarcerated individuals and those re-entering society, Islamic Family demonstrates a profound commitment to inclusivity and the well-being of all community members, even those in challenging circumstances. The successful advocacy for halal meals exemplifies their dedication to ensuring religious freedom and dignity within the correctional system.  
* 3.10. Community Engagement:  
  Islamic Family actively fosters connections and a sense of belonging within the Edmonton community by creating safe and welcoming spaces where individuals can connect and share their experiences.1 A central hub for these activities is "The Hüb," located in Edmonton, which serves as a vibrant center for various community activities and engagement initiatives. The Hüb hosts a wide array of events designed to bring people together, including Community Conversations that explore important topics and build understanding, Community Creativity sessions that foster artistic expression and connection, and various workshops focused on skill-building and personal growth.7 In 2024, The Hüb hosted 50 such events, highlighting its role as a dynamic gathering place.7 By providing these opportunities for interaction and shared experiences, Islamic Family strengthens social bonds and cultivates a strong sense of community identity among Edmontonians. The Hüb's transformation into a vibrant center for people of all backgrounds to meet, learn, and grow together underscores Islamic Family's commitment to fostering a warm and inclusive environment where everyone feels at home.8  
* 3.11. Refugee Sponsorship:  
  As a federally-approved Sponsorship Agreement Holder (SAH), Islamic Family plays a vital role in facilitating the sponsorship of refugees seeking safety and a new beginning in Canada.1 This accreditation allows them to assess the eligibility of refugees for sponsorship and approve family members as sponsors through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).4 Islamic Family provides crucial support to private co-sponsors throughout the complex application process.8 Their ability to act as an SAH signifies their recognized expertise and responsibility in navigating the intricacies of refugee sponsorship, enabling them to effectively assist both refugees and the community members who wish to support them in establishing new lives in Edmonton. In 2024, they processed over 150 refugee sponsorship applications, accepting more than 20 from families in Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.7 This dedicated effort underscores their commitment to providing pathways to safety and opportunity for vulnerable individuals and families.  
* 3.12. Evacuee Supports:  
  Islamic Family extends its compassionate reach to provide support for evacuees, offering assistance to individuals and families who have been displaced from their homes due to unforeseen circumstances.1 While specific details about the nature and extent of these supports are not fully outlined in the provided research material, the inclusion of this service demonstrates Islamic Family's commitment to responding to immediate crises and addressing the urgent needs of community members during times of vulnerability. This proactive approach highlights their dedication to providing timely and essential help to those facing displacement and hardship, further solidifying their role as a reliable source of support within the Edmonton community.

  Recognizing the value of accessible education, Islamic Family offers an online learning platform called "Learn with IslamicFamily".1 This initiative provides educational content on various topics, extending learning opportunities beyond the confines of physical locations and traditional schedules. While the specific subjects covered and the format of the online content are not detailed in the research material, the establishment of this platform demonstrates Islamic Family's commitment to leveraging technology to broaden its reach and provide valuable resources to a wider audience. This online learning capability enhances the accessibility of educational opportunities, allowing individuals to engage with learning materials at their own pace and convenience, thereby promoting lifelong learning and personal development within the community.  
* 3.14. Transform:  
  Islamic Family has embraced technological innovation to enhance its service delivery through the development of "Transform," an intake, assessment, and case management system designed for the social services sector.1 This initiative aims to streamline processes, reduce the administrative burden on social workers, and ultimately increase the time they can dedicate to direct client interaction.16 The development of Transform is a collaborative effort, with Islamic Family working alongside other prominent organizations in Edmonton, including the Bissell Centre, the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA), and Jewish Family Services Edmonton, to create a tool that can potentially benefit the entire social services sector.16 This forward-thinking project has garnered significant financial support, including more than $150,000 from MetaLab, the designers of Slack, to facilitate its development.16 The creation of this tailored digital platform underscores Islamic Family's commitment to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its services, ultimately leading to better outcomes for the individuals and families it supports.

* 4.2. Stories of Resilience and Growth:  
  Beyond the impressive statistics, the true impact of Islamic Family's work is best illustrated through the individual stories of resilience and growth within the community. Two compelling examples from 2024 highlight the profound difference the organization makes in people's lives.7  
  Miriam, a single mother from Afghanistan with five young children, arrived in Edmonton seeking a fresh start. Facing uncertainty about housing and her immigration status, she reached out to Islamic Family's helpline. The organization immediately extended a helping hand, securing temporary accommodation in a local hotel and providing meals during their initial days in Canada. Despite the daunting threat of deportation, Islamic Family, with the support of a local imam, diligently worked to appeal the decision. Their efforts, combined with the overwhelming support from the community who provided financial assistance and donations, ultimately led to a successful appeal, granting Miriam and her children the opportunity to stay in Canada. Islamic Family further assisted them in finding a comfortable apartment, and local organizations contributed essential furniture and bedding to furnish their new home. Today, Miriam and her children are steadily settling into their new life in Canada, with the children eagerly anticipating starting school and their mother looking forward to building connections within the Afghan community. This story exemplifies the power of compassion and unity in helping newcomers adapt to life in Canada, showcasing the comprehensive support network provided by Islamic Family.  
  Another impactful story is that of Kareem, who faced immense challenges after undergoing a life-altering operation resulting in the amputation of both of his legs. Evicted from his home while hospitalized, Kareem found himself in a precarious situation, residing in a hotel with nowhere else to turn. Upon receiving a call on their helpline, Islamic Family's compassionate staff worked diligently to understand Kareem's predicament. They arranged an intake appointment for him to secure housing through E4C, a local charitable organization dedicated to eliminating poverty, and two staff members accompanied him to ensure he had the necessary support. Recognizing Kareem's vulnerability as someone with no immediate family or support network and unable to stay in a shelter due to his medical condition, Islamic Family stepped in to provide ongoing assistance while he awaited housing. Their collaborative and compassionate approach, involving both staff and the wider community, aimed to make a positive impact on Kareem's well-being and support him on his journey toward stability and recovery. These stories serve as powerful reminders of the human element behind the statistics, demonstrating the tangible difference Islamic Family makes in the lives of vulnerable individuals in Edmonton.  
* 4.3. Advocacy for Halal Meals in Prisons:  
  Islamic Family has demonstrated a strong commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of marginalized individuals, including those within the carceral system. A significant achievement in this area is their successful advocacy for the provision of halal meals and essential resources for incarcerated Muslims.4 Recognizing the importance of adhering to religious dietary requirements, a dedicated colleague within Islamic Family's Prison Programming initiative tirelessly advocated for this crucial need. Through persistent efforts and effective communication with the relevant authorities, the government approved these requests, leading to the implementation of Islamic dietary options within the prison system. This victory not only ensures that incarcerated Muslims can observe their religious practices but also underscores Islamic Family's dedication to fostering religious inclusivity and upholding the rights of all individuals, regardless of their circumstances. This advocacy reflects a deep understanding of the importance of faith and cultural sensitivity in supporting the holistic well-being of individuals, even within the challenging environment of the correctional system.  
* 4.4. Global Stitches Program Empowerment:  
  Launched in 2018, Islamic Family's Global Stitches program stands as a testament to their innovative approach to community empowerment. This initiative is designed to teach refugee women in Edmonton advanced sewing and embroidery skills, providing them with a pathway to economic independence and community integration. The program goes beyond just teaching sewing skills; it also offers comprehensive entrepreneurial training to equip participants with the knowledge and tools necessary to launch their own sewing businesses.18 Each woman who graduates from the program receives a sewing machine and other essential tools to help them get started on their entrepreneurial journey.18  
  The success of the program is vividly illustrated by the story of Hodan Abdullah, a young woman who dreamed of becoming a fashion designer. After fleeing violence in Somalia as a child and later experiencing the civil war in Syria, Hodan arrived in Edmonton in 2015\. While she initially focused on improving her English and working in retail and healthcare, her passion for fashion remained. In 2019, she enrolled in the Global Stitches program and, upon graduation, gained the skills and confidence to apply to a fashion program at a local college.18 Her aspiration is to establish her own business designing modest and beautiful clothing for women, including plus-size options. The Global Stitches program is thoughtfully designed to reduce barriers to participation for refugee women. It provides complimentary bus tickets and offers childcare services for those with young children, ensuring that these women can fully engage in the training without significant obstacles.18 The program's success lies not only in the skills imparted but also in the supportive environment it fosters, where women can learn from each other, including those who had prior experience in the garment industry. By providing both practical skills and business acumen, Global Stitches empowers refugee women to overcome barriers to economic independence, build a sense of purpose, and actively participate in their new community in Edmonton.  
* 4.5. Canada Post Eid Stamp Featuring Children's Artwork:  
  A remarkable achievement that brought national recognition to Islamic Family and the Edmonton community was the creation of a Canada Post Eid stamp featuring a unique multicultural design.15 This commemorative stamp showcases a prayer rug that was made by children at Islamic Family nearly a decade ago, a project that beautifully celebrates the connection between Edmonton's Muslim and Indigenous communities.19 The design of the prayer rug is a testament to multicultural collaboration, created by a Metis artist who incorporated significant Indigenous symbols, including a lodgepole pine, Alberta's official tree, surrounded by triangular Cree symbols representing mountains and rivers. A colorful archway is also featured, symbolizing the purpose of prayer.15  
  Omar Yaqub, the executive director of Islamic Family, highlighted the significance of the stamp's release during Eid, noting that it provides a wonderful way for people to connect with family members and exchange gifts, much like Christmas or Hanukkah.19 Canada Post emphasized that the stamp celebrates the deep cultural connections and the historic multi-faith collaboration that led to the building of Canada's first mosque in Edmonton.15 The Canadian Prayer Rug, which inspired the stamp's design, was a project of The Green Room, Islamic Family's youth support program, created in 2016\.15 The rug's design, a collaboration between local Métis artist Kit Craven and Muslim weaver Noor Iqbal, was informed by research and interviews conducted by youth with Indigenous Elders and descendants of early Muslim settlers.15 This national recognition underscores Islamic Family's pivotal role in fostering multiculturalism and meaningful community engagement, demonstrating that even projects involving youth can have a significant and lasting impact. The selection of children's artwork for a national stamp serves as a powerful symbol of inclusivity and the positive influence of Islamic Family's youth initiatives. Furthermore, the collaboration with the Indigenous community highlights their ongoing commitment to reconciliation and building bridges between diverse cultural groups within Edmonton.
